## Notes

- If you want to change `MODKEY`, look for `#define MODKEY` in `config.h`.
- You can customize `termcmd`, `browsercmd`, etc., in the same file to use your preferred apps.

## Tips

- Use floating mode (`Alt + g`) when apps don't tile well.
- Combine `Alt + Shift + q` to cleanly close windows while staying on track.
- Customize `dmenu` with your own font/colors to match your rice.
